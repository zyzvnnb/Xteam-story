Nice to meet you too Charles! Hope you also have a nice semester! 

I really like playing basketball with my mother. Back in Beijing, I always used to break my mothers ankles, every single day. 
I really feel bad for her. She always has trouble making me sandwhitches. I am in the Chinese Basketball league and I dunked
on Lebron. Lebron is my mom by the way, just so you know.
